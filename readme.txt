Notable features: You will never play the same game twice!

1. Enemies have their own behaviour...some might stay still, some may        move, some might hit you when you fight them, some might steal your    goods

2. each time you move the shortest path from your location to the goal is  re-calculated: enemies might move to get on your way, depending on their behaviour (you will see "sinister sounds..." when that happens)
    
3. enemies are placed at random, in such a way that the strongest ones will be on the shortest path to the jungle: each of them is classified depending on their behaviour, their type and life points

4. items are placed randomly, following certain criteria, such as:
you won't be able to find a safe key in the same room where a safe is
at least initially, etc

5. doors are locked at random, following certain criteria, to make the game more intersting, but you are guarnateed to have a clear path to at least one door key

6. lastly: you should never ever get a simple "true" or "false" "Prologian" response to your queries in ay situatuion: at game start, during the game or when the game finishes, you will always be able to get a clear exlpanation to any of your queries assuming you use the ones provided to you.
